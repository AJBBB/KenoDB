For troubleshooting it logs all successes and failures into two HTML log files. \r\n\r\nAlso included is an Access database file with a table that has the correct header titles and rows created to import the data from the kenodbfull.csv file.\r\n\r\nPlease checkout the README on GitHub for more information.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Note to Windows Users\r\nUsing the task scheduler you can use the nightly.bat file to create a nightly task. Just edit the nightly.bat file to fit your file locations / Windows Username. Then you can add a basic task to run nightly.bat.
