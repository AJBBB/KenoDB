For troubleshooting it logs all successes and failures into two HTML log files. \r\n\r\nAlso included is an Access database file with a table that has the correct header titles and rows created to import the data from the kenodbfull.csv file.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Note to Windows Users\r\nUsing the task scheduler you can use the nightly.bat file to create a nightly task. Just edit the nightly.bat file to fit your file locations / Windows Username. Then you can add a nightly task to run the nightly.bat file. For more information on scheduling a task click the link below.\r\n\r\n[_Microsoft Schedule a Task Guide_](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc748993.aspx)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n[![Python 2.*](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7-blue.svg)](http://python.org) [![Contact AYJAY](https://img.shields.io/badge/contact-AYJAY-orange.svg)](mailto:ayjay@programmer.net)\r\n",
