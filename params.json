  "body": "### Welcome to KenoDB\r\nThis program is setup so you can easily track Keno numbers. It outputs several files, a full log of the day's numbers in multiple formats and other draw info, as well as a list of the numbers drawn for the day in a single row to do pivot table analysis on the hot/coldness of numbers. For troubleshooting it logs all successes and failures into two HTML log files. Also included is an Access database file with a table that has the correct header titles and rows created to import the data from the kenodbfull.csv file.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Note to Windows Users\r\nUsing the task scheduler you can use the nightly.bat file to create a nightly task. Just edit the nightly.bat file to fit your file locations / Windows Username. Then you can add a nightly task to run the nightly.bat file.
